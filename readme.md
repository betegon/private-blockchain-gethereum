# Private blockchain with geth
This is a quick introduction to create private blockchain networks over Ethereum using geth.

## 0. create a home  blockchain folder: #
$ mkdir ethereum 

0. export variable: WE HAVE TO DO IT EVERYTIME WE START A NEW TERMINAL.
$ export ETHEREUM_HOME='/home/betegon/Desktop/ethereum' # check that it is ok: $ $ETHEREUM_HOME and also check: $ printenv | grep ETHEREUM_HOME

1. create genesis file (chainId: 15, for future references the network id will be 15).

2. Initialize first node: 
$ geth --datadir "$ETHEREUM_HOMEÂº/node1" init "$ETHEREUM_HOME/genesis.json" # this will create a node in the path given .../node1

3. Start interactive geth  javascript console (so powerful for sending transactions, starting the miner...): 
$ sudo geth --datadir "$ETHEREUM_HOME/node1" console 2>console.log # we want to save all logs in console.log
> eth.blockNumber   # check we are in block 0 (only the genesis block has been created).

4. once in the console type: > admin. and press "tab" (2 times) to see all options you have
5. We can see our node info: > admin.nodeInfo # shows the ip, ports and so on. we will need to use other different port for other nodes (obviously). It also outputs enode: ... this defines our node. to identify it we will use the last 4 hexadecimal numbers before 939f@62.42.(ip)
6. another important for creating accounts,list them, list wallets...: > personal. (press tab 2 times) and shows up all options
7. We will create our first account:
> personal.newAccount()
8. see if the account is well created: 
> personal.listAcounts 

10. Initialize second node: 
$ geth --datadir "$ETHEREUM_HOME/node2" init "$ETHEREUM_HOME/genesis.json" # this will create a node in the path given .../node2. SEE THAT WE use the same genesis block!



11. Start interactive geth  javascript console second node 
$ sudo geth --datadir "$ETHEREUM_HOME/node2" --port 30304 --nodiscover --networkid 1234 console 2>console.log # different port from 1st node. also nodiscover for avoiding the node to attach to other neighbor blockchain (this is little paranoid, but just in case). and network id.



 geth --datadir path/to/custom/data/folder --networkid 15
